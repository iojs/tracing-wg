# Using Valgrind

A Node.js process may run out of memory due to excessive consumption of native
memory which can lead to a native crash. Valgrind is a diagnostics tool on Linux
machines to help investigating native memory leaks.

Check out the [Investigating Memory Leaks with valgrind](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/guides/investigating_native_memory_leak.md) guide to learn more about how to use
Valgrind.
