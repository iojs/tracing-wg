## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

  - Diagnostics Agenda @ Collaboroator Summit (https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues/71)
    - see issue for details
    - on table for discussion:
      - Semantics of Async
      - Promise Hooks proposal
      - exit critier of async hooks
      -
  - Strategic Initiatives/Champions like we have on TSC [#185](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/185)
    - @mmarchini did some cleanup on issues
    - Agreement we should get a "Champions" assigned to each strategic initiative
    - Some concern that a single "Champion" isn't right, so we agreed to have a single "Champion" and then some number of interested "stakeholders"
    - Open question on how to track these.
    - @kjin volunteered to try out github's wiki feature for this.
    - alternatives are tracking champions/stakeholders in each tracking issue

  - Diagnostics Channel - Next steps [#180](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/180)
    - @qard built a prototype a few weeks ago. Waiting for feedback
    - @qard volunteered to be the champion on this initiative.

  - Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
    - chime in on issues for any deep-dive topic proposals

  - Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
    - @mmarchini has a PR open on v8 that enabled code event listeners.
      - expects this to land in v8 by May 29. 
      - V8 6.7 https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19989/
    - @mmarchini has a PR open on node to ensure CPU profiling functionality doesn't break
    - 

  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Ali opened issue on exit criteria for Async Hooks (#194)
    - Big thing here is a regression in Async Hooks on node 10.
      - optimizations by v8 team broke Async Hooks
      - v8 doesn't have tests & node doesn't have tests to ensure things continue working
   - Issue #188 on changes needed to Promise Hooks to get fix perf.
     - Discussion died down, @ofrobots needs to  resurrect
  
  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - Aiming to PR async context work into Diagnostics WG next week
    - Don't expect terminology to be final, but we want to force the conversation
    - @mrkmarron to be at Collab Summit to discuss this face-to-face.

  - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
    - Tracking issue needs updated
    - @jasnell volunteered to be the champion of this.
    - Lots of work happening on this front:
      - JS APIs for trace events added
      - Perf Events now emit trace events
      - PR open to get trace events exposed through CrDP
      - TL;DR; quite a bit of functionality has been added
  - still early, try it out, flush out the bugs
  
### nodejs/TSC

  - Discuss blocking on Zones proposal [#340](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/340)
    - No champion currently
    - general agreement that we need to land the Async Context formatlization first, and Zones can be defined on top of that
    - removing from Diag agenda.
