## Notes

## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Integrate C++ AsyncHooks Embedder API with native abstraction [#13254](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/13254)
  - @ofrobots spent time on this
  - will have one PR for NaN
    - will get async context propagation automatically if NaN module is using Async Worker.
    - NaN APIs not using Async Worker won't get automatic propagation
    - NaN exposes low-level APIs that, if used, will break context. 
    - Ideal would be to make it "hard" to do the "wrong thing" wrt Async Context propoga
  - meta-issue around what to do about NaN vs NAPI going forward, and what to do about NaN APIs that make it hard to propagate context 
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - [ ] @ofrobots to open PR on NaN for context propagation when using Async Worker
    - [ ] @ofrobots to open issue on what to do about NaN APIs going forward relative to NAPI. 

### nodejs/diagnostics

* Get @mike-kaufman permissions issue to create hangouts/livestream as "node.js"  [#138](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/138)
  - doesn't appear to be done.
  - need to follow up with @mhdawson

* Get out of monkey patching [#134](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/134)
  - issue is better summarized
  - a "path forward" set of next steps is listed
  - seems like there is initial agreement 
  - Should discuss at summit to see how we execute on proposed plan.

* \[async-hooks\] request for feedback [#129](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/129)
  - no more feedback
  - perf seems to be an issue
  - #124 is updated with an task to identify "acceptable" performance
  - @watson/Elastic is using async-hooks for their apm agent, but it is in beta & it is turned off
    - don't have a workable solution when certain constructs are used
  - @ofrobots - need to understand how async hooks perf compares to alternative techniques (i.e., monkeypatching)
  - @ofrobots - real world data would be really useful here, vs benchmarks
  - open question - is async-hooks API the "right API"?
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - [ ] @watson, @danielkahn - to try to get some perf data here.   

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  - see above

* Diagnostics WG Summit - Feb 12-13, 2018 - Ottawa, ON Canada [#121](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/121)
  - @danielkhan - has a google doc where we can fine-tune agenda:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mB3nrCOhgKPEpPebpUEBDZQse6yKX4vwuwj-RpAWXWI/edit?usp=sharing
  - will iterate on this doc, review fine-tuned agenda
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - @danielkhan, @mike-kaufman - continue to fine-tune/clarify agenda, try to review at WG meeting before summit

* Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
  - started doing slide-show visualizations: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mike-kaufman/async-context-definition/blob/master/examples/simplePromise/slideShow/async-context.html
  - @ofrobots mentioned other interesting code scenarios.
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - @ofrobots to put interesting code examples into issue in https://github.com/mike-kaufman/async-context-definition.   

* \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
  - @ofrobots made some v8 PRs to get bring more trace_events features to node
  - no progress on other issues in this list

### nodejs/benchmarking

* Perf/Node.js [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/168)
  - no update

### nodejs/post-mortem

* Meta data for llnode - Node.js version 8 [#50](https://github.com/nodejs/post-mortem/issues/50)
  - no update
