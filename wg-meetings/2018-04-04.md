    - still open
    - please add topics

  - Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
   - update posted [here](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/178#issuecomment-378691558)
 
  - Diagnostics Channel - Next steps [#180](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/180)
  

  -  Eliminate Monkey Patching for Diagnostic Instrumentation  [#134]
(https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/134)
   - closed this as next steps are captured in #180

  - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
    - progress on JS API in PR:  https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19803
    - read PR for discussion of details

  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - no update
    - last action was a write-up on how to address promise hooks perf
  

  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107]
    - some progress on automatic-monkey-patching to generate model events [here](https://github.com/mike-kaufman/async-context-definition/blob/mkaufman-add-monkey-patch-tracking)
      - still some gaps
      - don't hold back
    - "continuation" API
      - https://github.com/mike-kaufman/async-context-definition/blob/mkaufman-add-monkey-patch-tracking/async-track/src/continuation.ts
      - this shows what API to track context would look like.
      - fits event model we've been describing
      - can implement in native code  
    - showed JSAV UI for this
      - feedback is it isn't usable at scale
      - intent was to illustrate concepts of the async context model  

  - Visualizing Async Context [#179](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/179)
