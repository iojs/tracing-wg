## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

 - * Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
   - deep dive on profiling happened
   - 5-6 attendees, was productive
   - some actions came out of this

 - * Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
    - Some actions from deep-dive, but names were not assigned
    - For now, focus on PR, as changes there may cause changes in other actions


 - * Eliminate Monkey Patching for Diagnostic Instrumentation  [#134](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/134)
    - no update
    - **ACTIONS**:
      - @mhdawson to open issue to drive discussion about code repo and what code to use to start this


 - * \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
   - Yang is going to put together doc on what to do in order to make it perform better
   - Has not yet had enough time to do that, but has had some discussions with Ali
   - Help a lot to not attach the resource to the promise hook.  Just pass an async id instead.
   - Spec has a lot of temporary promises, but they are not observable in regular JS, but they
    are through promise hooks. Question is if we can skip those?  Matteo, should be ok as long
    as context is preserved and is in tact when you are out of them
   - Promise hook should not be bound to isolate but instead to the context. (Would fix electron
    issue).
   - v8 has improved performance of promises, which is widening impact of promise hooks
   - ~50% impact of promise hooks on some benchmark (hapi)
  

 
 - * Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - Mike K has some code which is monkey-patching node libraries to generate async events.
    - not quite working yet
    - Nothing else to report this week.
    - **ACTIONS**:
      - @mike-kaufman to discuss monkey-patching code next week
      - @kjin to open issue to demo/discuss a visualization tool he's been working on

 - * \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
   - no update

 - Q&A, Other
   - 0x v4 released based on the tick profiler, same output logic for both kernel tools and tick
    Profiler
   - **ACTIONS**:
     - David/@mcollina to push an issue in the Diag repo to start discussion. Maybe will ask him to do demo 
    next week.
