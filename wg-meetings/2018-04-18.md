## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

 - Diagnostics Channel - Next steps [#180](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/180)
   - @qard added link to some prototype code for pub/sub channel
   - no other progress
 - Visualizing Async Context [#179](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/179)
  
 - Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
  - please update if anyone has any topics 

 - Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
   - PR in v8 was merged last week
   - will be available in v8 6.7 release
   - node v10 will ship with 6.6
   - Ali:  is this worth backporting to v8 6.6?
     - @mmarchini: @hashseed not optimistic
     - see discussion [here](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/183#discussion_r182600716) for more detail
   - @mmarchini is starting to look at a new code event listener API
     - API will be covered by tests, and will prevent breaks in future
   - **ACTIONS:**
     - [ ] Ali to look into PR & start conversation about back-porting to 6.6[]  

 - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
   - No update here - waiting on a doc about how to address promise hooks perf issues
   - Blocking thing here is perf
   - Zones was brought up in TSC meeting - does it need to be resurrected?
     - Some people would like to see Zones come back
     - acknowledgement that "async context" is a missing piece of node/javascript programming model
       - whether zones or not is TBD
     - Matteo shared a deck 
     - discussion raised more questions than answers
     - some concern about perf of Zones always being on.
     - Ali:  Zones was on by default in Dart, we could reach out to Dart folks to understand perf impact of this
     - Ali: v8 team thinks they can support zones more efficiently in v8 than promise hooks
   - Ali:  Async Hooks has high overhead, it listens to way too many events    
   - Matteo:  He has some perf measurements that show Async Hooks has ~8% overhead & is more efficient than monkey-patching approaches.
   - Is Async Hooks going to be out of experimental for v10?
     - Diag WG should make recommendation to TSC on this
     - We need a list of criteria to exit experimental
   - **ACTIONS:**
     - [ ] Ali to start list of exit criteria #124     

 - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
   - update to terminology in this PR: github.com/mike-kaufman/async-context-definition/pull/18/files
   - Frames problem around concept of a `Continuation` - which is a function that passed from one async context and then when invoked starts another
   - 

 - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
   - ran out of time here
