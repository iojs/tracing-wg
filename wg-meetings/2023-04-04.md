### nodejs/diagnostics

* TC39 proposal AsyncContext [#608](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/608)
  * Chengzhong
    * has been a while since discussed in this venue
    * have been working over the last year to get a AsyncContext proposal added to language in
      TC39 - reached stage 2 just recently
    * Next step is to find more use was and work through perf and other issues in the browser
    * Good time to discuss in diagnostic wg and provide feedback
    * We should also discuss migration path
  * Michael understand it was based on AsyncLocalStorage, how big will the migration be
  * Chengzhong - already some work by James Snell
    https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/46262 due to differences in semantics 
  * Want people to be aware/review to make sure proposal matches expectations
  * Michael should we work to get broader input on proposal
  * Step 1
    * Get Diagnostics WG feedback
  * Maybe later step, then broader feedback. Stage 2 proposal is not far enough along for
    broader feedback later.
  * Ask is that people from the Diagnostic WG review the proposal and comment either in
    https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/608 or open an issue in the proposal repository.
  * Stephen, James Snell talked about plans to re-write AsyncLocalStorage to not use async
    hooks, but instead on V8's context ContinuationPreservedEmbedderData APIs.
  * Chengzhong, probably not a good idea to migrate to the new API as V8 suggested
    the APIs are still experimental and can be changed significantly.
  * Some methods in AsyncLocalStorage are not part of AsyncContext, Stephen is working on\
    seeing if Datadog can work around not having them.
  * Stephen think it is mostly compatible, have some some additions in mind for
    AsyncLocalStorage, but holding off on Understanding if those would also be
    compatible with AsyncContext

* User Journey tracking documentation [#502](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/502)
  * Need Rafael in the discussion so lets skip until next time

* Stephen
  * Proposed session for collaborator summit - https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues/349
  * Any good agenda items for that?
    * Already includes AsyncLocal Storage
  * Michael good summary of diagnostics Channels work that Stephen has worked on would be
    good as opportunity for greater visibility and feedback.
