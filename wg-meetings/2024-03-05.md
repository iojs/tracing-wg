### nodejs/node

* diagnostics_channel: early-exit tracing channel trace methods [#51915](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51915)
  * diagnostic channel designed to have separate events, so you could listen to just subset of
    events
  * if you started listening to a channel you might get only end events, but you might get before
    after ones for others.
  * Challenge is that there are optimizations that can be applied if the check can be done
     when first event occurs versus every time there is an event
    * undici is considering re-implementing to avoid needing a closure, but current behaviour
      means that you need to always do stuff versus checking for subscribers at start of event so
      you get all or nothing.
    * to see an event the listener needs to be in place at the start of the event
