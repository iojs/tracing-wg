### nodejs/diagnostics

* Expand the scope of deep dive meetings [#417](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/417)
    * Good idea
    * We can either wait to finish UJ or jump to other topics
    * Discuss during issue
* Continue unified hooks discussion [#401](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/401)
    * Will continue to work on diagnostics channel stuff
    * Will open an issue to share context
    * Diagnostics channel: idea from a few years ago to have a general data fire hose(?)
        * There were some performance concerns around it
        * Trying to redesing so we can still have the fire hose deliberately without overhead when not in use
    * Difference between this and Node.js tracing?
        * OpenTracing is more (?)
        * More like the `debug` module, where you create a named channel and put data there
        * Pub/sub system where subscribers subscribe for a particular name
        * Construct and produce data _if_ there's a listener for given name
* discuss: node.js contributor survey [#398](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/398)
    * Gireesh is not here, so skipping
* Discuss usage and support of eBPF [#386](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/386)
    * Removed from agenda
* Reviving "Zones" like proposals to TC39 [#375](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/375)
    * Presented on last TC39 meeting
    * Didn't advance
    * Still some concerns around dynamic scoping
    * Will be discussed in an incubator call in a couple of weeks
    * No actions from Diag WG in the next few weeks
    * Can remove from agenda
* COVID-19 and WG sittings [#370](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/370)
    * No changes
    * Will close the issue later
* Improving automated remote connection via Inspector Protcol [#348](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/348)
    * Will present a demo on next meeting
* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    * Some async stuff got backported recently that broke older(?) users
    * Shouldn't block advancement though
    * Apparently Myles has a fix PR somewhere
    * Stephen: personally don't see any paths to ever getting it to stable
        * From my perspective it's the internals for things that people should actually use, like AsyncLocalStorage
        * Eventually we should deprecate it as an exposed thing
        * Not now, but when public APIs cover the actual use cases for async_hooks
