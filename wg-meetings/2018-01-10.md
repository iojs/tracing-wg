## Notes

### nodejs/node

* Integrate C++ AsyncHooks Embedder API with native abstraction [#13254](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/13254)
  - issue is stalled
  - how do we communicate this with a broader group?
  - **Actions**
    - [ ] @ofrobots volunteered to look into this

### nodejs/diagnostics

* \[async-hooks\] request for feedback [#129](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/129)
  - Do we have enough feedback & is it useful? 
  - [bluebird issue #1472](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/pull/1472) on perforance of async hooks is related to this.
  - @danielkhan -  they're support down to node v4, and haven't had time to invest in a 8.x/9.x solution only - their monkey-patching still works
  - @ofrobots - want to know if API is stable & useful
  - **Actions**
    - [ ] @mike-kaufman - summarize feedback in here & roll it into [async_hooks] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124) 

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  - should merge in summarized info from #129

* Diagnostics WG Summit - Feb 12-13, 2018 - Ottawa, ON Canada [#121](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/121)
  - Do we want to get to next level of detail on agenda items?
      - existing open work items?
      - common themes?
      - expected outcomes/results from summit?
  - Do we have a large node user attending?  e.g., netflix?
     - belief is we do, but if anyone thinks someone's presence is valuable, they should invite them. 
  - @mhdawson - "bring your coat"
  - **Actions**
    - [ ] @danielkhan - pick one of the agenda items & see if you can add next level detail/clarity based on your company's internal discussions. 
    - [ ] @mike-kaufman - pick one of the agenda items & see if you can add next level detail/clarity.

* Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
  - progress is being made in write-up
  - current plan is to use jsav.io to visualize DAG state transitions.
  - feel free to provide feedback on doc.
   
* \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
  - APIs for new timestamp macros being worked on by @ofrobots.  
    - should land in v8 next couple of weeks
  - potential disconnect between perf_hooks & trave_events
    - @jasnell is working on some perf-hooks instrumentation that is similiar to browser peformance APIs
    - @AndreasMadsen thinks there's impedence mis-match between two API sets
    - @ofrobots believes gap here is because of timestamp macros 
  - **Actions**:
    - [x] @AndreasMadsen to update Diag Summit agenda w/ item to discuss perf_hooks vs trace_events

* Get out of monkey patching [#134](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/134)
  - there's open-census & open-tracing efforts, that are related, yet different
  - looks like some things are lining up w/ open-census effort
  - we need more clarity on details
  - **Actions**
    - [ ] @mike-kaufman - update issue to clarify use cases to ensure we're all on same page

### nodejs/benchmarking

* Perf/Node.js [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/168)
  - flame graphs still broken
  - tooling stability is on agenda for summit

### nodejs/post-mortem

* Meta data for llnode - Node.js version 8 [#50](https://github.com/nodejs/post-mortem/issues/50)
  - Problem here was mdb, not llnode
  - a test was added node to identify cases when metadata gets out of sync
  - not ready to close this issue just yet.
