  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Open PR [21313](github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21313), eliminates need for destroy callback & significantly improves perf
      - this is stalled
    - perf is still biggest ?
    - @ofrobots:  if we want something from v8, we need time to let it land
    - need to figure out the story in next 3 months if we want this stable for node 12.
