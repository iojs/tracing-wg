## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

* Add using clinic/heap-profiler step [#521](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/521)
 - rafael: the issue is opened to discuss possibility of recommending clinic/heap-profiler in our docs
 - gireesh: we have incorporated many third party tools in the past, so should not be an issue
 - bradley: license agreements in 3rd party tools is what makes it problematic.
 - third-party tool can be recommended only if it is open-source licensed (MIT).
 - all: agree.
* Document async_hooks types purposes [#511](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/511)
- rafael: some async_hook resource types are underdocumented / undocumented
- bradley: properties are not supposed to be stable, and they can change types based on future changes. it is ok to document those, but needs some tests to make sure they are always in sync with the code changes.
- stephen: personally prefer to be explicit in the doc about what the type of a resource is and what it can hold, in reality.
- tony: is there a tool that synchronizes the code and the doc?
- stephen: it is not practical; there could be more subjective things to add in the doc such as API contract versus an arbitrary type, so prefer manual updates.
- rafael: going to update the issue, follow the suggestions, and remove from the agenda.

* meeting time, again [#507](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/507)
- gireesh: bradley, pls update your preferences in doodle, we will visit it in the next meeting once all preferences are in place.

* User Journey tracking documentation [#502](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/502)
- rafel: just an information on the tweet that we just realized. Tony is here because of that. the label can be removed and progress can be made on the documentation work.

* Identify async_hooks use cases beyond AsyncLocalStorage [#437](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/437)
- stephen: there wasn't any movement on this, take off the agenda.
