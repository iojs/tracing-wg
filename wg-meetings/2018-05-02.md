## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

  -  Strategic Initiatives/Champions like we have on TSC [#185](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/185)
    - Question about what is the difference between an "issue" and a "strategic initiaitve"?
      - i.e., why not just use issues to track things & assign the issues to owners?
      - problem is that there are multiple issues under the same umbrella. 
         - e.g., cpu profiling has 3 or 4 issues
    - **ACTIONS:**
      - [ ] Clean up issues
      - [ ] Create tracking issues for broad things that span multiple sub-issues
      - [ ] Discuss individual ownership of these tracking issues
      - [x] Add a Label for "Tracking-Issue"

  -  Diagnostics Channel - Next steps [#180](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/180)
    - no update

  -  Visualizing Async Context [#179](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/179)
    - Nothing here.
  
  -  Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
    - Please chime in here for anything you'd like to deep-dive on

  -  Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
    - PR open for code events listener
    - should land in next few weeks

  -  \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - No exit criteria exists for async_hooks
    - Update from Yang on Promise Hooks  performance

  -  Different async_hooks behavior in Node 10 [nodejs/node#20274](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/20274) 
    - not discussed

  -  Proposal for Promise hooks to improve performance. [#188]
    - Doc is linked via issue
    - Goal w/ doc is to address perf impact of Promise Hooks
    - Measured impact on Hapi benchmark - 70% perf impact by introducing promise hooks
      - part of this is v8 getting faster with their promises. 
      - as v8 gets faster, the gap increases, since promise hooks forces v8 onto slow paths that don't contain optimizations
    -  One problem is per spec, every await has 4 promises
      - 1 of these is "throw-away"
         - "probably doesn't matter to most users" (big assumption in this statement)
      - use of promise hooks implies need to call 4 hooks for each promise, so async-await has large number of calls from native -> JS
      - these calls are missed by V8's optimizer
    - Doc lays out various options to address perf gap.

  -  Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - we're tweaking terminology
    - will look to make a PR of documents into Diagnostics WG to force conversation
    
  -  \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)

  -  Showcasing some new profiling tools at the next WG meeting  [#186]
    - Demo on "Bubble-prof" from @mafintosh
    - they will make this available to anyone that wants early access
    - Reach out @mafintosh or @mcollina for early access
