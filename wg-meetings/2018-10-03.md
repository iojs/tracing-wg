  - Session at Collab Summit Vancouver 2018 [#229](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
    -  rough agenda in the issue
    -  @kjin to produce some overview slides that go through first sets of bullet points
    - working sessions identfied for async context (@mike-kaufman to drive) & for post-mortem debugging of promises (@hekike to drive)
    - currently diag break-out is scheduled for same time as promise debugging session
      - can we do anything to move this?
      - may not be able to?
    - mateus marcini is going to do a working session on llnode 

  - Diagnostics "Best Practices" Guide? - [#211](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/211)
    - Let's kick off a meeting here after node interactive
    

  - Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
     - @mike-kaufman doing a talk on async context at 11:40 on Wednesday
     - let's see how working session at summit goes, and then schedule a follow-up if necessary 

  - Expectation about tier of support from diagnostic tools and VMs [#157](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/157)
    - initial list is checked in here:  https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/guides/diagnostic-tooling-support-tiers.md
    - now we need to move some stuff up
    - PR open on getting node-report into core
    - issue [#234](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/234) to get node clinic moved to tier 3
      - some gaps in test coverage that resulted in breaks to clinic identified - these need to be filled
    - Profiling APIs 
      - Action here is to "document the gaps" where things are "partially tested" and then fill those gaps
      - use profiling APIs here as an example of how we "move things up" in level of support

   
  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Open PR [21313](github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21313), eliminates need for destroy callback & significantly improves perf
      - @ofrobots to drive a discussion at summit w/ appropriate people
  
  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - PR  https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/197 open, would love feedback
    - will schedule a deep-dive
