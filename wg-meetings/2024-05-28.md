## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

* Transfer of import-in-the-middle [#634](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/634)
  * Discussions:
    * Which team will take the responsibility of this module?
    * James: Loaders has initiatives that overlap with the intention of this module
    * Rafael & Yagiz: We believe nodejs/diagnostics should take the lead in this module
    * Rafael: This is also a good way to make this team more active. We should make sure that this team will be active enough to support this new module/initiative.
    * Yagiz/Abhi/James are willing to participate in the working group meetings and of course, in the support of import-in-the-middle package.
  * It seems there are a significant number of contributors who would like to support the maintenance of this module as well as participate in other working group initiatives and that ends the meeting

* New website is live and the diagnostics section could use some love. ❤️  [#630](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/630)
