## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda**  labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

  - Next Diagnostic Summit #201
    - proposal is to do this around node summit in July @ netflix offices 
    - concern that there is limited time for people to plan for this, and this isn't very inclusive
    - general consensus is that people who are in town can get together in July informally
    - Will try to land on a diag summit in october timeframe
    - **Actions**:
      - @yunong to update #201 with plan for any informal summit meetings
      - @yunong to post on an issue about proposed dates/locations for next summit

  - Strategic Initiatives/Champions like we have on TSC [#185](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/185)
    - Done, issue closed.

     - **Actions** 
       - @mhdawson  has action for Tiers
       - @mike-kaufman has action for async context deep-dive

  - Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
    - making progress
    - Yang what is still missing is that it does not work for inlined functions. 
    - @mcollina thinks this is ok - if he wants to avoid inlined functions, he can just pass a flag to disable them. 

  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Not much progress since collab summit
    - Discussion at summit around if we are ready.  General discussion was that we needed
    the semantics as a pre-req before we would want to make them non-experimental.

  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - PR posted, some comments been added
    - A few themes are coming out, he needs to post those and then update do. Mike mentioned
    these:
      - how does this work with generators
      - how does it work for async await
      - how do we simplify traversals
      - please review and provide feedback

  - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
    - @jasnell volunteered to be champion here
    - trace events now in CrDP
    - UI is available in Chrome Dev Tools perf tab
      - still some gaps here, some work happening, but it is progressing
    - @ofrobots working through bugs
    - @jasnell is still working through intrinsics

  - Expectation about tier of support from diagnostic tools and VMs [#157](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/157)
    - Discussed at the summit, we need to put together list and then work on what the
    support levels should be for each.
  - nodejs/node#21313
    - discussion, but take back to github for future progress.
