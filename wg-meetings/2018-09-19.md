## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda**  labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

  - Session at Collab Summit Vancouver 2018 [#229](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
    - need someone to drive
    - produce some slides/agenda that includes the following:
      - overview of diag WG
      - where we need help
      - deep dives (e.g., async context)
    - @mhdawson & @kjin agreed to try to get a cut
    - should have confidence this is handled at the 10/3 meeting

  - Diagnostics "Best Practices" Guide? - [#211](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/211)
    - limited progress

  - Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
     - @mike-kaufman to schedule deep-dive on async-context formalizations. 

  - Expectation about tier of support from diagnostic tools and VMs [#157](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/157)
    - now we need to move some stuff up
    - PR open on getting node-report into core
    - issue [#234](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/234) to get node clinic moved to tier 3
    - some discussion here that it may be better to have a more targeted tool here, or API-level tests
    - something smaller is easier to reason about than clinic, which is pretty broad
    - issue [#234](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/234) discussion updated w/ summary

   
  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Open PR [21313](github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21313), eliminates need for destroy callback & significantly improves perf
      - this is stalled
      - current pushback is some http parser resources are pooled and shared across requests
      - @hashseed of opinion that we should try to get this unstuck since it addresses perf impact
      - @ofrobots to schedule a "doodle" on this w/ appropriate people 
      - if needed, we can add to agenda of things to discuss at summit
  
  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - PR  https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/197 open, would love feedback
    - will schedule a deep-dive

  - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
    - @ofrobots investigating threading issues on shutdown, has some fixes
    - wants to use pefetto
      - thinks this can be done w/out changing APIs
    - would be nice to see a demo of all the things that can be done with trace_events
