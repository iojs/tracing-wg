## Agenda
  - **Time zone shift:**  
      - In US, we shifted from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time (moving from UTC-7 to UTC-8).  This meeting remained at UTC 20:00 & did not shift to account for DST.
      - Node.js calendar was not updated
      - not clear we have quorum, but agreed to discuss what we could
      - **Actions:**
        - [x] fix calendar

  - **Async-context formalization and diagnostics support**  [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
     - Interest for others to get involved in this, in particular @kjin.
     - @mrkmarron, @mike-kaufman have a very rough draft of a document to "democratize" what's in the OOPSLA paper
     - Plan was to get this concrete enough such that we can get useful feedback.
     - Form will be a mark-down document in a PR that ppl can provide feedback on.  
     - Currently, document is on an  microsoft-internal GH repo.  Will try to find a way to either make public or grant access to others in the interim, in particular @kjin     
     - Need to move this forward, will shoot to have something public by 11/29 meeting
     - Good discussion on "async context"s
       - @ofrobots  - we need to communicate why "async context" is a relevant problem.  Thinks long stacks are a good motivating example.
       - general high-level discussion about the DAG model about async context.
       - analogy of thread/thread join brought up 
    - **ACTIONS**:
      - [ ] @mike-kaufman - figure out how to grant access to early draft of md
      - [ ] @mrkmarron, @mike-kaufman - get draft polished up enough to make public & make a PR to diagnostics GH repro
