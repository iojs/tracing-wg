## Agenda

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the
**nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

* Future of llnode [#355](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/355)
 * Mattheus: proposing to remove review restrictions because other maintainers 
   are less active and this is blocking to make progress on important things
   like Node 12.x release. This one took months and we fell behind the LTS
   schedule. Which prevented people from using llnode on Node 12.x. Because of
   the nature of llnode it needs rapid iteration to keep it sync with V8
   upgrades.
 * Michael: we could introduce something like after some time it can land if
   nobody looks at it.
 * Matheus: that could work
 * Michael: what would be the reasonable time for this auto approval window?
 * Mattheus: how about 3-4 days?
 * Michael: is it under node/*
 * Matheus: yes
 * Peter: how to announce this change?
 * Matheus: I’ll open a PR and ping diagnostics and llnode teams
 * Consensus was made on “auto approval after 3 days”
 * Peter: do you want to discuss more on the future aspect?
 * Matheus: this was the important one, more contributors would be good and I’m
   thinking about a refactor that would make entry bar for new contributors
   easier.

* reportVersion semantics are not defined 
  [#349](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/349)
  * Peter asked why have a separate version number from Node.js version, and if
    there were precedents of doing that
  * Number is separate because a major Node.js version might not change the
    report format. It's easier for tools consuming the report to deal with a
    sequential number separated from the Node.js version
  * N-API also has its own version not tied to Node.js version
* Proposal to drive Diagnostics WG initiatives through user journeys 
  [#295](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/295)
  * We discussed memory leaks user journey and tooling (see docs below)
  * Ran out of time, we'll continue this user journey on the next meeting
* Diagnostics "Best Practices" Guide? 
  [#211](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/211)
  * Nothing to discuss
* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue 
  [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  * Nothing to discuss
