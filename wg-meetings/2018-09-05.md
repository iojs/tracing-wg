### nodejs/diagnostics

  - Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
     - @mike-kaufman to schedule deep-dive on async-context formalizations. 

  - Diagnostics "Best Practices" Guide? - [#211](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/211)
    - general agreement that this will be a good thing
    - at a minimum if it is just a list of links, that's a start that we can improve on
    - leave on agenda & try to make progress 

  - Expectation about tier of support from diagnostic tools and VMs [#157](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/157)
    - original PR that lists tools has landed
    - now tools need to be categorized into some tier (they're all uncategorized now)
    - we will leave open to track progress
    - next steps are to start moving tools into tiers
    - there's a PR open on node-report moving into core
    - Code event listeners can move up since we now have tests
      - Mateus or Peter to open a PR on this
   
  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Open PR [21313](github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21313), eliminates need for destroy callback & significantly improves perf
      - this is stalled
      - current pushback is some http parser resources are pooled and shared across requests
  
  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - PR  https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/197 open, would love feedback
    - will schedule a deep-dive

  - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
    - @mhdawson pinged James, didn't hear back
    - some things in this list are done, some things are missing
    - @ofrobots said he'd try to find some time to clean up
    - one thing that is missing is production-quality implementation for an event store
    - perfeto is project that chromium is moving to
    - some refactoring to change v8 to accept a pluggable implementation for the store would simplify things here.

  - discussion on how to keep llnode working
    - matheus is looking into how to metadata for llnode is emitted
    - trying to find a new way to analyze core dumps
    - last 4 or 5 v8 updates broke llnode
    - 1st prototype that Matheus did had poor perf
      - calculated memory offsets of various properties
    - trying another approach to use an API on v8 and let v8 do the calculations efficiently.
