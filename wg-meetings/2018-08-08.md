## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda**  labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

  - Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
     - @mike-kaufman to schedule deep-dive on async-context formalizations. 

  - Expectation about tier of support from diagnostic tools and VMs [#157](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/157)
    - @mhdawson has PR open
    - bunch of feedback
    - some signed off, waiting for more to sign off
    - need to keep pushing until we get there
   
  - \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
    - Open PR [21313](github.com/nodejs/node/pull/21313), eliminates need for destroy callback & significantly improves perf
    - some feedback in PR that this should not go in
    - May need to set up a meeting for this to start getting more traction
    - Yang discussed another possibility for perf improvement here, which is to use JS callbacks instead of native callbacks for the promise hooks
      - eliminates JS->native hop, which is expensive
      - requires moving v8 promise-hook API from isolate to context (since JS functions are bound to context)
        - has benefits in fixing electron issue
      - discussedin write-up yang did a few months back
      - summer now, so no progress is being made


  - Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
    - PR  https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/197 open, would love feedback
    - will schedule a deep-dive

  - \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
    - node is using v8's default trace controller
    - this is a mock implementation only used for testing
    - has known race conditions
    - chrome isn't using this controller
    - android team is building perfetto, which is a richer trace controller
      - should be compatible w/ v8 trace_events
      - thinking about switching to use this
      - won't happen until node 11
    - another short-term approach is we may be able to grab whatever controller chrome is using
