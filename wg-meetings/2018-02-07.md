## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Integrate C++ AsyncHooks Embedder API with native abstraction [#13254](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/13254)
  - Ali has posted proposal/plan, actively working through it.  Please take a look and
    add comments if you have them.


### nodejs/diagnostics

* Eliminate Monkey Patching for Diagnostic Instrumentation  [#134](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/134)
  - discussion in issue
  - there's a proposal for a plan
  - will discuss execution steps at Diag summit week of 2/12

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  - Promise hooks are quite expensive to enable by default, node does not do that
  - Benedick, looking at overall hook performance to see how it might be improved
  - Should work with V8 team to see if there are changes to promise hooks to make
    them move efficient.  This might cause changes in other hooks as well so may be a
    reason not to exit Experimental until we figure that out.
  - Another idea is limiting the number of promises for which hooks are triggered, by
    skipping those that are not interesting may be able to make cheaper.
  - Also discussing if for a real-world workload the overhead is going to be seen.  Original
    benchmark really stresses Promises which may not be realistic
  - Discussion around JavaScript API to avoid transition back and forth between JavaScript
    and C++.
  - Discussion around using approach in chrome for post-mortem as well. 
  - Ali will open a tracking issue for Promise hooks on v8 tracker performance to capture links to
    all of these discussion and track progress.
  - Mark, do we understand where the overhead is coming from?
  - Yang, no one single bottleneck.  Cost of crossing boundary (4 times), having weak global
     Handle. If you await a function, you get 4 promises (times 4 for boundary crossing)
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - [ ] @ofrobots to open tracking issue to summarize variety of approaches & track progress  


* Diagnostics WG Summit - Feb 12-13, 2018 - Ottawa, ON Canada [#121](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/121)
  - summit next week
  - refined agenda is here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mB3nrCOhgKPEpPebpUEBDZQse6yKX4vwuwj-RpAWXWI/edit#
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - [ ] all - send info to @mhdawson to ensure wireless access
    - [ ] all - refine/review agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mB3nrCOhgKPEpPebpUEBDZQse6yKX4vwuwj-RpAWXWI/edit#

* Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
  - working on the doc, PR going into with major update
  - async object lifetime, async context tracking 2 different things
  - example visualizations are progressing
  - **ACTIONS**: 
    - @mike-kaufman, @mrkmarron  - try to fit in presentation at the summit. If not schedule for upcoming meeting.

* \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
  - no update

### nodejs/benchmarking

* Perf/Node.js [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/168)
  - Can we have a set of profiling APIs for node?
  - something maintained & supported?
  - **ACTIONS:**
    - [ ] @yunong - open issue in github where we can have discussion

### nodejs/post-mortem

* Meta data for llnode - Node.js version 8 [#50](https://github.com/nodejs/post-mortem/issues/50)
