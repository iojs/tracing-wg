### nodejs/diagnostics

* Expand the scope of deep dive meetings [#417](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/417)
  * Expand the scope beyond journeys
  * No objections
* Revisit meetings frequency [#426](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/426)
  * Suggestion to alternate in the meeting (at the start we give updates on items on the agenda, afterwards deep dive).
  * Try to keep the topics minimal, remember to remove stalled and non-relevant items
  * Let's try it :)
    * Next week no meeting
    * Sept 2nd meeting: first 15-ish minutes for updates, rest for deep dive
* discuss: node.js contributor survey [#398](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/398)
  * Not much to discuss, lost traction
  * Removed from agenda until gets traction again
* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  * Fix thenables, ???, broke test for some reason
  * There's a memory safety issue that needs to be fixed
    * Unlikely to happen in real world cases
  * Been working on other stuff, not much progress on async hooks front
  * Personally on the opition that async hooks should never be stable, but should stay on the agenda
    * Preferably it becomes an internal thing and higher level abstractions become stable
* Improving automated remote connection via Inspector Protcol [#348](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/348)
  * *presented*
  * Can we close the connection after it's opened?
    * not remotely
  * Does it incur overhead while connection is open?
    * No, only when running commands
  * If we add to core, can we close?
    * No
  * What are the steps to add to core?
    * Move repo to foundation, open PR
    * Might face pushback due to dependencies
