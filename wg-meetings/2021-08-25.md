## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* async_hooks: multi-tenant promise hook api [#39283](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/39283)

  * still waiting for feedback, there is no agreement on the shape of the API. Hoping to get more reviews on the PR
  * needs consensus on the API placement - should it be a top level module, or can be shipped under async_hooks?
  * also we need to decide on the name of the module without conflicting with npm libraries

 * Helio brought-in a new topic:
   * Helio: How to track execution of synchronous functions
   * Is it worth making some tools to identify synchronous and asynchronous?
   * Rafael: we can only measure the event loop, node clinic might be doing it, other tools like zeroX, etc.
   * Rafael: without native addons, this capability is mostly not possible.
   * Gireesh: probably worth opening an issue to discuss this further.
   * https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/495 is opened to take this forward

### nodejs/diagnostics

* docs(linux-perf): add tutorial of linux_perf [#493](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/493)
  * good to land, had sufficient reviews
* feat: add debugging blackbox section [#490](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/490)
  * good to land, had sufficient reviews
* Identify async_hooks use cases beyond AsyncLocalStorage [#437](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/437)
  * still can have more feedback, the related issue is active with discussions.
