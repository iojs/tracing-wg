## Agenda

Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org*- prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/diagnostics

### nodejs/diagnostics

- Diag WG Deep Dives - topics [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/168)
  - Discussed and we agreed it is a good idea.
  - Will schedule for every other meeting
  - People should add suggestions for topics in the issue

- Diag WG meeting times? [#158](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/158)
  - Changed time, closing

- Deep dive meeting on CI testing to ensure tools compatibility [#156](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/156)
  - Closing in favor of #168

- Node CPU Profiling Roadmap [#148](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/148)
  - Prototype has been done that allows interpreter stack frames to be visible by perf
  - will make a PR to v8
  - open question on what tests will look like
  - end-to-end tests are good, but will introduce a dependency on perf
  - this is a good topic for deep dive
  - **ACTIONS**:
      - @andreasmadsen (?) to put together outline if what needs to happen to line up the steps to make
    this happen.
     - @mmarchini (?) to update #168 w/ suggestion of this as a deep-dive topic

- Eliminate Monkey Patching for Diagnostic Instrumentation  
[#134](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/134)
  - Matteo, they will be measuring and reporting performance deltas between monkey patching and async hooks

- \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  - pending bug fix to address Electron issues will make perf of Promise Hooks worse than it already is
    - Electron apps have two "contexts" - one for the embedder and another from v8
    - Promise Hooks model has one "context" per isolate
  - May necessitate changes in Promise Hooks API
  - May also necessitate changes in Async Hooks
  - **ACTIONS:** 
    - @hashseed - will write a proposal for Promise Hooks changes.  Can verify impact on API then. 
  

- Async-context formalization and diagnostics support [#107](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/107)
  - Nothing new to report on this.

- \[trace_event\] tracking issue [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/84)
  - Lots of discussion on this
  - @jasnell has several PRs up and is working on some other changes (e.g., trace points for DNS lookups)
  - one open question is what data is useful to trace
  - @mhdawson is looking into Java to see what kind of data they're tracing now
  - discussion on pros/cons of different trace provider implementations.

### nodejs/benchmarking

- Perf/Node.js [#168](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/168)
  - Close in favor of #148
