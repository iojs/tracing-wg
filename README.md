# Diagnostics Working Group  
The goal of this WG is to ensure Node provides a set of comprehensive, documented, extensible diagnostic protocols, formats, and APIs to enable tool vendors to provide reliable diagnostic tools for Node.

Work is divided into several domains:
- [Tracing](./tracing)
- [Profiling](./profiling)
- [Heap and Memory Analysis](./heap-memory)
- [Step Debugging](./debugging)

Background, reference documentation, samples, and discussion for each domain is contained within its folder.

Work needed includes:  
- Collect, understand, and document existing diagnostic capabilities and entry-points throughout Node, V8, and other components.
- Collect and document projects and products providing diagnostics for Node with brief description of their technical architecture and sponsoring organizations.
- Identify opportunities and gaps, then propose and implement solutions.
